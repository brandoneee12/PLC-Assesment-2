# PLC-Assesment-2
PLC Exam

In this problem you will be designing code that should be able to take in a file that is analyzed for lexical and syntactical correctness. This programming language should allow for the following type of statements:
• switch
• foreach
• for
• while
• do-while
• block
• if
• assignment • return

- For my practical assesment my lexical analyizer is based on Java rules.
- The output is as follows: 
  - the for loop tokens 
  - the type of statement (For-each, while.. etc)
  - the actual loop from randomstuff.txt
